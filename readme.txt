== Description ==

**Trendpilot Automation Engine: Data-driven Optimization for your Woocommerce store**

Maximize the performance of your WooCommerce store with powerful, data-driven automations. 

Create custom data conditions that trigger as your data changes, so your storefront and product details automatically stay optimized for conversions.

Spend less time on manual updates and focus on what matters most, with features like:

**Dynamic Pricing Adjustments:** Automatically update prices based on stock levels, demand, or custom metrics to maximize revenue opportunities.
**Real-Time Storefront updates:** Easily update upsells, recommended products, top bar text, badges, and more. Highlight high-demand items and drive sales automatically.
**Product Visibility Management:** Control which products are displayed, hidden, or promoted to keep your storefront fresh, relevant, and optimized for conversions.
**Data Monitoring Alerts:** Receive email alerts when stock levels are low, sales trends shift, or key features are updatedâ€”keeping you informed and responsive to changes.
**Essential Analytics:** Track key store metrics to refine your strategies and continuously optimize your automations.

== Feature List ==

- **Automation Engine:** Set custom rules and actions in our automation builder to keep your store optimized daily. The engine analyzes key store metrics and performs automated actions, including store and product updates.
- **Analytics:** Gain insights on essential interactions, including product views, category views, upsell add-to-carts, and recommended section clicks.
- **Recommended Section:** Adds a new 'orderby' option to the Woocommerce shop page, 'Recommended'. Use this section to keep key products at the top of your shop and archive pages.
- **Product Page Upsell Popup:** Display an upsell popup when items are added to the cart, with the ability to dynamically update the upsell product based on your defined rules.
- **Top Bar:** Showcase a message at the top of your site using our customizable top bar. Messages can be updated automatically via the automation engine.
- **Product Badges:** Add customizable badges to product images, such as "Sale," "Popular," "New," or any custom text you like.
- **Product Displays:** Create banners and displays for your products which are dynamically changeable via the automation engine.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What triggers my automations? =

Automations are triggered once a day at a time of your choosing. We will assess your conditions and update your storefront and products accordingly.

= What is the 'Recommended' section? =

Adding a product to the recommended section puts that product at the top of all archive pages. That includes your main shop page, relevant category pages and search pages. 
This allows you to highlight products based on data.
